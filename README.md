# Collective Intelligence System
## Fork of @nikmart's Interaction Engine framework

Basic set up is:

Stepper's -> Arduino -> Pi -> Node.JS -> Wifi (GroupInteraction) -> Laptop

Web page button is pushed (html) ->
JS (client.js) funtion called ->
Server.js logs activation and pushes character to Pi Serial Port ->
Arduino registers character and triggers behavior

Look inside Arduino Sketch for the behavior triggering characters and corresponding Stepper motor movements


## COMMANDS
1, 2, 3         : Look at person 1, 2 and 3 respectively (rotation)

M, N, B         : Lean forward, upright and backward respectively (tilt)

W               : Wiggle (Shake tilt back and forth), has to be exited (space key)             <- Needs work (Slow down)

L               : Lookaround (Rotate back and forth), has to be exited (space key)             <- Needs work (Slow down)

A, S, D         : Look around, with swooping (tilt forward and back)                  <- Needs work (Not working currently)

R               : Reset, move everything back to 0

' ' (Space key) : Exit motion but hold position





To run this example:

1. clone the repo
2. upload the `helloYouSketch.ino` to your Arduino
3. run `node server.js /dev/ttyACM0` using node (make sure your Arduino port is correct)

Notes:

To connect Arduino to Kinect, one potential way is to run Arduino on same laptop as Kinect, use Visual Studio to push character to serial port, then Arduino will register serial port character and trigger behavior, bypassing the Pi and Node.js (not ideal but could be done to get things up and running)
